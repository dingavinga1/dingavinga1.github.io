It had been a stressful day for her because it took her an entire day to analyze some performance results. You might be wondering: Sure, it takes time to actually run performance tests but how can it take an entire day to analyze the results? Well, I must admit that the “taking the entire day” part is a ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Polymorphism Hidden in Plain Sight?</title><link href="https://dingavinga1.github.io/posts/Polymorphism-Hidden-in-Plain-Sight/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Polymorphism Hidden in Plain Sight?" /><published>2024-09-17T11:48:00+05:00</published> <updated>2024-09-17T11:48:00+05:00</updated> <id>https://dingavinga1.github.io/posts/Polymorphism-Hidden-in-Plain-Sight/</id> <content src="https://dingavinga1.github.io/posts/Polymorphism-Hidden-in-Plain-Sight/" /> <author> <name>Abdullah Irfan</name> </author> <category term="Blogs" /> <category term="Software Engineering" /> <summary> Yes. Today, rather than revisiting the traditional Animal-&amp;gt;Cat and Animal-&amp;gt;Dog example, we’re going to look at a real-life example of polymorphism that all Python developers probably interact with on a daily basis. But first, let’s clarify what polymorphism actually is. According to ChatGPT, Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Instant Cloud VMs With a cURL Command</title><link href="https://dingavinga1.github.io/posts/Instant-Cloud-VMs-With-a-cURL-Command/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Instant Cloud VMs With a cURL Command" /><published>2024-02-06T12:29:00+05:00</published> <updated>2024-02-06T12:29:00+05:00</updated> <id>https://dingavinga1.github.io/posts/Instant-Cloud-VMs-With-a-cURL-Command/</id> <content src="https://dingavinga1.github.io/posts/Instant-Cloud-VMs-With-a-cURL-Command/" /> <author> <name>Abdullah Irfan</name> </author> <category term="Blogs" /> <category term="Cloud Computing" /> <summary> Cloud computing has been around for a while, and we all know its basics. Some things are easy to navigate around, and some aren’t, but I think we should all agree upon the fact that the consoles provided by Google, Azure and AWS are a bit disappointing when it comes to UX. Google is a king when it comes to the tech-verse but somehow, they managed to mess up web socket integration in their clo... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Getting Started with .NET 8 Core as a Complete Noob</title><link href="https://dingavinga1.github.io/posts/Getting-Started-with-.NET-8-Core-as-a-Complete-Noob/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting Started with .NET 8 Core as a Complete Noob" /><published>2024-01-10T16:44:00+05:00</published> <updated>2024-01-10T16:44:00+05:00</updated> <id>https://dingavinga1.github.io/posts/Getting-Started-with-.NET-8-Core-as-a-Complete-Noob/</id> <content src="https://dingavinga1.github.io/posts/Getting-Started-with-.NET-8-Core-as-a-Complete-Noob/" /> <author> <name>Abdullah Irfan</name> </author> <category term="Blogs" /> <category term="Software Engineering" /> <summary> Why Choose .NET Core in 2024? Why would you choose .NET Core when you have a billion other frameworks to choose from? You have Django for the Python magic, you have NestJS for it’s native support for Javascript. Why do you go out of your way to work on an overly complicated framework based on C#? Well, here’s a few reasons why you might have to without wanting to: Client Needs: .NET fr... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Setting up your own Beowulf Cluster on Docker as a PoC</title><link href="https://dingavinga1.github.io/posts/Setting-up-your-own-Beowulf-Cluster-on-Docker-as-a-PoC/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Setting up your own Beowulf Cluster on Docker as a PoC" /><published>2023-09-08T11:44:00+05:00</published> <updated>2023-09-08T11:44:00+05:00</updated> <id>https://dingavinga1.github.io/posts/Setting-up-your-own-Beowulf-Cluster-on-Docker-as-a-PoC/</id> <content src="https://dingavinga1.github.io/posts/Setting-up-your-own-Beowulf-Cluster-on-Docker-as-a-PoC/" /> <author> <name>Abdullah Irfan</name> </author> <category term="Blogs" /> <category term="Distributed Computing" /> <summary> Why? Due to the ever-evolving world of information technology, computational needs are increasing day by day while the ability to miniaturize processors is about to reach its cap. That is where parallel and distributed computing comes in! With the concept of parallel computing, you can train a single AI model on multiple machines simultaneously. How? Just buy a few machines and setup mpicc. Bu... </summary> </entry> </feed>
